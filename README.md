ABSTRACT: Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is one of worldwide medical challenges with high morbidity and death rate. Since there is no symptom during the early stages of CKD, patients often fail to diagnose the disease. Based on the glomerular filtration rate, the CKD stages are also calculated for patients diagnosed with CKD.
