# Identification-Kidney-Disease-ML
 FINAL YEAR PROJECT

ABSTRACT:
Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is one of worldwide medical challenges with high morbidity and death rate. Since there is no symptom during the early stages of CKD, patients often fail to diagnose the disease. Based on the glomerular filtration rate, the CKD stages are also calculated for patients diagnosed with CKD.


Introduction : 
Chronic Kidney Disease(CKD) is an incurable condition of kidney associated with higher risk of many other diseases such as heart failure, anemia, and bone disease.
In many cases, patients do not feel symptoms until disease is in last stage.

Proposed System :
In this project, we are implementing 6 ML models using, KNN,SVM, random forest, decision tree, ada-boost and xg-boost algorithms, along with a simple deep neural network to classify weather a patient has CKD or not. For binary classification situations, A SVM (support vector machine) is a classification-based supervised machine learning model. K-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithm utilizes feature comparing to predict a value according on how closely it is similar in the training dataset.

Advantages : 
It achieves better accuracy in classification CKD in HIV patients
It provides the comparative analysis of different ML Models

Conclusion : 
In this project we have compared the performance of state of art machine learning algorithms along with DNN for classification of CKD for patients having HIV.
